Monitors content updates on the server via ajax and pushes content to the front-end without user action. Allows site-owners to provide live updates!

== Description ==

Primarily targeted at theme and plugin developers. Makes it easy to update content on a page without any action required from the user.

This plugin monitors the content of key value pairs on the server via ajax and calls any registered callbacks on the client side when one of those values changes.

Contains optional functionality to directly update a text value on the page without requiring you to setup a callback, and contains an optional widget for code-free use.

Feel free to copy the core files into your project or set-up a dependancy. We are going to keep it light so it is easy to reuse. All user interface points can be blocked or modified via hooks, so you can make this totally your own.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

OR, use the plugin interface in your WordPress admin
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Do I have to know code to use this?

A: No, it will work out of the box, but we built it to make things easier for other developers, since this is a frequently needed feature as part of a larger solution.
